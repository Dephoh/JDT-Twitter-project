# JDT-Twitter-project

This is a project created as part of participation in the Hack4Impact BU Spring semester 2023.

We used html, javaScript, and CSS as the frontend and MongoDB as the database.

Over the course of this project we better learned how frontend and backend development are integrated and organized.

Use live-server to monitor the html in index.html and use nodemon to run the index.js server.
